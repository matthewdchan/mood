### Our purpose

With the theme of UGAHacks9 being "be the hero of your story" we wanted to create a self-help app. We decided to achieve this through the creation of a journaling app, where a person can record their experiences that day. We also included inspirational quotes and useful links in our header.

### Tools utilized

We used the MERN stack to create our app (Mongo, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). We also used the moment.js library to auto fill the current date for each journal entry.

### Problems we ran into

We were easily able to implement adding new journal entries to our database, but being able to edit and delete them was much harder to accomplish. We were able to overcome these issues by reading articles online about how to implement reading and deleting data.

### Public frameworks used:

Express.js,
React.js,
Node.js,
Moment.js
